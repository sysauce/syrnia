<h1>Getting Started in Syrnia</h1>
Hello and welcome to Syrnia! This guide will get you up and running with the basics of game play  in no time! Once you finish the tutorial island you will find yourself in Sanfew. The only things  you'll find here are the island of Remer's Jail and a few player made shops. So the first thing  you will want to do is move to another city.  <br />
<br />
To move to from Sanfew look at the mini-map in the top right of the playing screen and click on  the dot next to Rynir Mines. While you wait for the timer to count down we'll take a look at  the rest of the play screen.  <br />
<h3>Inventory</h3>
To the top-left of your screen is your inventory. These are the items you have in your  possession. You begin the game with the following: Beginners horse, a Bronze Dagger, a Bronze  Pickaxe, a Hammer, a Net, a Tinderbox, and a Bronze Hatchet. When you click these items, you  will equip/un-equip/use/eat them. <br />
<br />
<h3>The Buttons</h3>
Just below your inventory is some buttons. <br />
<br />
These are, in order: <br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Options</span> - to change your password.  <br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Messages</span> - Where you can send and receive secure  messages to fellow players or game staff. To contact game staff, open the Messages tab, and select &quot;<em>Contact the game staff, use the ticket system</em>&quot;. Give the ticket a title, select which category it goes to and tell us what the problem is. Then decide how you want us to contact you. If you choose to have us email you with a response, you must provide a valid email.<br />
<br />
Or you can also use this:<br />

<br />
</font><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quests </span>- Quests and Jobs you are currently doing will  be displayed in here.  More information is available on the <a href="http://www.syrnia.com/index.php?page=manual&amp;m=quests">Quests</a> page.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Forum</span> - is where you can post messages that everyone can  see. Good sections to take a look at when your just starting out are the general, help and clan topics.  <br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Clan</span> - Where you can join or create a clan. Once you're  in a clan you can post messages for your clan mates to read in the forum, see on the news page  important information posted by the clan leader, and see who is online and where they are in Syrnia on the member list.  <br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Logout</span> - is for logging out when you're done playing. <br />
<br />
<h3>What you're wearing </h3>
Below the buttons you will see what looks like a cut out of a person. This represents what  armor/weapons you are wearing. If you click the Bronze Dagger in you inventory, you will see  it equipped as your weapon. <br />
<br />
<h3>City Menu</h3>
Just to the right of your inventory you will see a column headed &quot;City Menu&quot;. This is where you  will be able to select the various actions to do in each city.  <br />
<br />
Under the city menu, you will see a list of player names. You can click on a player name to see  what they are wearing and have an option to attempt to thieve them. Below the player list is a  dropped items section. If there is ever anything on the ground it will be displayed here and  you can choose to pick the items up.  <br />
<br />
<h3>Maps</h3>
On the right side of the screen just under the mini-map you will see a &quot;View Full World map&quot;  link. If you click on this you will see a full map of Remer Island. At the bottom of the map is  another link where you can see the world of Syrnia. From there you can click on the individual  links to see maps of all of the other islands, including Skull Island, the fabled home of the  pirates.  <br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.syrnia.com/images/worldmap.php?map=full"><em>&quot;Full Syrnia World Map&quot;</em></a><br />
<br />
<h3>Skills</h3>
If you look on the right of your screen, in the middle, you will see a picture representing  every game skill in a column. By clicking any one of these pictures you will see a pop-up  appear with the skill details for your character. There is also some facts like how long you  have been playing etc.  <br />
Syrnia has many skills you can work on. Skill building requires Experience (Exp, or &quot;xp&quot;),  which is gained every time you perform a skill. <br />
<br />
Just a little above the skill pictures you will see, from the top, your current health, your  current gold (GP) then the total of your skill levels, your combat level (CL, is a combination of your health, strength, attack and defense levels,) and the last is your fame.  Fame is gained by being one of the top three fighters to prevent the pirates from capturing a  town, or you can gain negative fame by becoming a pirate and donating resources to the pirate  stockpile and when a city is successfully captured during an invasion.)  <br />
<br />
<h3>Chat</h3>
At the bottom of the screen is the chat window where you can talk to everyone that plays Syrnia. There are five chat channels in Syrnia, each with its own purpose.  <br />

<h3><font color="#000000">Island of Remer</font></h3>
<font color="#000000">Now that you are familiar with the playing screen it's time to get to know the game it self a  little better. By now you have reached Rynir Mines. Here you can start mining tin and copper  ores (and once you reach level 10 mining you can mine Iron ore.) You will need equal amounts of  tin and copper ore to make bronze armour, weapons and equipment. To mine equip your pick and  click either &quot;mine tin&quot; or &quot;mine copper&quot;. (See <a href="http://www.syrnia.com/index.php?page=manual&amp;m=mining">Mining</a> for more details).<br />
<br />
If you decide to explore the island, first move north to Lisim. This is where you can begin to  fish shrimp with your net equipped and once you level up to level 5 and buy a rod you can also  fish sardines, herring and mackerel. Eventually with your net you can also fish trout here as  well.   (See <a href="http://www.syrnia.com/index.php?page=manual&amp;m=fishing">Fishing</a> for more details).<br />
<br />
Continuing north of Lisim you will find Valera. Here you can buy mules at the stables, or you  can visit the training grounds. We recommend waiting to fight until you have a full set of  bronze armour and a weapon. You will also want a good stock of cooked fish or crops to heal  with. Optional is a house (750 wood to build one with a hammer in any city) in which you can  safely store your GP and any extra items you have that you would not want to loose if you die  in combat. Should you die in combat you loose everything in your inventory, but you keep your GP and all of your experience. (See <a href="http://www.syrnia.com/index.php?page=manual&amp;m=combat">Combat</a> for more details).<br />
<br />
After Valera you have a choice. To the left is Endarx, where you smelt ores into bars and then  with a hammer can smith the bars into items (see <a href="http://www.syrnia.com/index.php?page=manual&amp;m=smithing">Smithing</a> for more details). To the north of Endarx is a dead end where you  will find the city of Rile and the school where you can train your construction and trading  skills up to level 10 for GP. (See <a href="http://www.syrnia.com/index.php?page=manual&amp;m=constructing">Construction</a> and <a href="http://www.syrnia.com/index.php?page=manual&amp;m=trading">Trading</a> for more details).<br />
<br />
To the right of Valera you will first find the city of Isri where you can woodcut with a  hatchet. During woodcutting you find seeds which you can plant on farmland at your house/s (750 GP buys a small 25 slot farm which you make using a spade,) and random rare small chests which  you can open to get a free items from.  (See <a href="http://www.syrnia.com/index.php?page=manual&amp;m=woodcutting">Woodcutting</a> for more details).<br />
<br />
From Isri you move further to the right and you find the market city of Eully. Here you can  trade items to other players at the Trading post, put items up for auction at the cave of  trades or bid on items. You can buy and sell basic items at the market as well if your really  short on GP or need to replace a piece of equipment. You can also meet Bluebell here and begin  several quests for her.  (See <a href="http://www.syrnia.com/index.php?page=manual&amp;m=quests">Quests</a> or <a href="http://www.syrnia.com/index.php?page=manual&amp;m=magic">Magic</a> for more details).<br />
<br />
South of Eully is the city of Harith where you can cook all of your fish, as long as you have a  an equal amount of wood to the amount of fish you have and a tinderbox equipped. In Harith you  will also find Remer's House of Floral where you can sell the flowers you find walking around  each of the islands. Each type of flower means something different and once the shop has 10 of  one kind of flower in stock you can pay a fee and send a bouquet of flowers to another player.  (See <a href="http://www.syrnia.com/index.php?page=manual&amp;m=cooking">Cooking</a> for more details)<br />
<br />
The last and final stop on the tour of Remer Island is Port Senyn, here you can fish using a  small fishing boat. You can catch pike, cod or salmon once you have the correct fishing levels.  For 20gp you can set sail for Dearn Island or for 50gp once you have enough levels  you can enter The Outlands. However if you have a boat of your own, you can travel to most places in Syrnia for free! The larger the boat, the faster you can sail to a location.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A warning</span>: The Outlands is where you can fight other players, and can be killed by them. You can train any skill here with low times, but at high risk. In order to protect new players, you cannot enter this dangerous place unless you have 60 Total Skills or a Combat Level greater than 5.  <br />
<br />
And here ends our the tour of Remer Island. If you need more detailed information on each of the skills you can <strong>click on the pictures at the top of the manual.</strong> We at Syrnia wish you the  best of luck! Have fun and happy gaming!</font>
