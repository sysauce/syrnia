<h1> 			<img src="http://www.syrnia.com/images/skills/thieving.gif" alt="" /> Thieving 		</h1>
Put simply, Thieving is the art of stealing without being noticed. A good thief  		will gain gold from other players, and not get sent to jail that often!  		Speaking of jails, every island has got its own jail.<br />
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Player Thieving<br />
</h3>
<br />
Player thieving is simple to undertake but is also rather difficult to succeed in. Choose a player who is at the same location as yourself and search for their name in the &quot;Players at this location&quot; list. Select their name and below the player's stats will be a link to &quot;Thief player&quot;. Click the link and you will have a go. The result will be seen instantly. If you are successful, you will be notified that you have stolen money from them. The amount you receive is random, but the more money the player has on them, the more money you are likely to get. The target is not told about the attempt and you are also given an option to try again. For a successful thieving attempt you earn 20 EXP.<br />
<br />
If you fail to steal from them however, you will be captured and put into jail. The player is told that you have attempted to steal from them. Jail time varies but is decided by your thieving level compared to your target. If you have a higher level than your target, you will get more time in jail. The lowest time available though is 150 seconds (2 minutes 30 seconds). Even if you fail though, you will still get 5 EXP for trying.<br />
<br />
<h3>Shop Thieving</h3>
At level 10, players can attempt to steal items from shops. Go to a shop and next to every item is an option to steal the item. The higher the price, the lower the chances of being successful. There is always a chance of being successful no matter what the price, however the chances might be very low. If you are successful, you will take the item and have an option to go back to the shop. Like player thieving, the owner of the shop is not told if you have been successful. If you fail to steal the item though, you will be caught and thrown in jail. The player will be told of your attempt and your time in jail depends on what you tried to steal. For every gold piece the item was worth, your time in jail increases by 25 seconds. So for example, a 10 Gold pieces item would result in a jail time of 250 seconds.<br />

You can also attempt to steal gold from a shop. This is more risky but the rewards can be much greater. On the shop window, click the button at the top to steal gold. If you are successful, you will take gold that the shop is currently storing and gain 30 EXP. The owner is not notified of your attempt. Failure however, results in a fixed 30 minute jail time. The player will also be warned and you do gain 5 EXP for trying though.<br />

<h3> 			The Thief Guild 		</h3>
The <em>Thief Guild</em> is located on Mezno Island at the town of Mentan. You  		will need to do the thieving trail quest before you can enter however. When you  		are a member of the thieving guild you will be able to do special theiving jobs  		that will gain you gold as well as thieving experience (exp). For these jobs, you are usually given a time limit and a target. You will be told their last known location and you will need to thieve them to scare them. You must be swift, find your target and strike. Success or failure in your attempt does not matter. You will have scared them enough to satisfy the guild. Then make your return to the guild in your own time to collect your reward. The quicker you strike, the greater your reward.<br />

<h3> 			Locked Chests</h3>
Another good way to practice thieving is picking locks, however you need locked chests which are hard to get. Using a lock pick you will be able to open locked chests. Simply equip the lock pick and then select the box you wish to unlock. Wait for the timer to reach 0, and the box is unlocked and ready to open.<br />

<h3>Special Events</h3>
Every so often, a mysterious crate will appear somewhere. These boxes are combination locked and the combination is usually within a certain range. Players usually get one guess every 20 seconds. You can guess as many times as you like with every failed attempt getting you some experience for trying. The amount of experience you will get depends on how many possible numbers there are. More numbers available means more experience. If you open the box though with the correct combination, you shall receive whatever mysteries lie within...
