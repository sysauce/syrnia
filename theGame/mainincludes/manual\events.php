<h1>( Random ) events in Syrnia 		</h1>
There are various (random) events within Syrnia:<br />
<ul>
    <li>Invasions</li>
    <li>Contests</li>
    <li>Chests</li>
    <li>Party</li>
    <li>Arena Matches</li>
</ul>
<strong>Invasions<br />
</strong>This is when random numbers of monsters attack a place in Syrnia. A place that is being invaded will have all its features disabled. You will not be able to work there, access houses or shops or even thieve other players in a place that is under attack. Players must then work together to defeat the attacking monsters within a matter of minutes. If they are not killed before the timer reaches 0, the monsters will take control of the town and their numbers will increase, making them harder to kill. If they are beaten however, the top three players based on the number of kills, will receive a gold bounty for their hard work. See <a href="http://www.syrnia.com/index.php?page=manual&amp;m=combat">Combat</a> for more information on fighting.<br />
<br />
<strong>Contests</strong><br />
A contest will require you to deliver a certain item to a location, and the one to bring the best of that item will win a prize. You can enter as many times as you like, keep searching to find the best item you can get and win the prize.<br />
<br />
<strong>Chests</strong><br />
The first to open the chest will get the contents. You will need to guess a number within a given range. See <a href="http://www.syrnia.com/index.php?page=manual&amp;m=thieving">Thieving</a> for more information.<br />

<strong>Party Island<br />
</strong>At special occasions, a mysterious island becomes available. This is usually accessible at most major holidays, e.g. Easter, Christmas or to celebrate Syrnia's anniversary. Boats are available to the island from Senyn, Crabs Nest or Burning Beach. There is also a boat from Kanzo at times but there is not a boat to return to Kanzo. There are various things that can be done at different times of year. The key part of the island is the Syrnian Celebration Center. At Christmas, Santa will give out one gift per person, at Easter you meet the Easter Bunny and so on. This is also the location of the islands trading post. Also, if there are any contests going on, this is usually where you can submit your items.<br />
North of this is Holiday Lake. Here you can either fish with a net or rod for normal fish, or alternatively, if you use a net, you may be able to find a stripey red fish. However, at some times of the year, an organisation known as &quot;S.S.S.R.F (Syrnians to Save the Striped Red Fish)&quot; will prevent you from fishing there. Instead there will either be something else available or it will not be used in that event.<br />
West of the centre is Festival Forest. Here you can chop down trees and try to get Christmas Trees or you could find Balloons and various other items.<br />
<br />
Party Island is only available at certain times and it will usually be announced in advance. After it has served its purpose, it will vanish. Any players left on the island will be returned to either Senyn or Crabs Nest.<br />
<br />
<strong>Battle Arena<br />
</strong>Every so often, Arena battles will be scheduled in the Desert Arena. These are unannounced, so you need to check to see when the next match will be. These matches are a fight to the finish with only the strongest player left standing as a result. There are two places where you can access the Arena from, these are Kinam and Toothen. If you wish to enter one of these fights, there are several rules that you must follow:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Make sure you have the right 	Combat Level. If you are higher than the level boundary then you 	will not be allowed to compete. If you are too low, it will also 	refuse entry.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Remove all cooked food and edible 	items from your inventory. You have to empty out your inventory of 	anything edible. This can either be done via a house or leaving them 	with someone. You can take raw fish into the arena and cook them at 	no wood cost.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Remove all locked items from your inventory. This is the same 	as with food. Either store them in a house or with another player.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>When the timer reaches 0, all players are free to enter the arena. This is no risk combat. If you are defeated in the Battle Arena, you are returned to your point of entry completely unharmed. You keep all the items you had on you. However it will register that you have been killed by a player if you check your statistics. The match continues until one player is left standing. The winner receives combat experience in their chosen skill and wins a Desert Arena Medal. They are then returned to their entry point. See <a href="http://www.syrnia.com/index.php?page=manual&amp;m=combat">Combat</a> for more information.  </p>
