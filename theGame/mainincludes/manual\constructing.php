<h1> 			<img alt="" src="http://www.syrnia.com/images/skills/constructing.gif" /> Constructing 		</h1>
From shops to ships, there are many things to build in Syrnia. Constructing is  		the skill you need to take advantage of building shops, boats and houses. Like  		the Trading skill, Constructing is a skill which you can study for. But unlike the trading skill, you can gain experience in other ways, such as building houses or shops. You also need Construction to build fishing boats and catch bigger fish (see <a href="http://www.syrnia.com/index.php?page=manual&amp;m=fishing">Fishing</a>). Wood is a key part of this skill, so you may need a lot of it (see <a href="http://www.syrnia.com/index.php?page=manual&amp;m=woodcutting">Woodcutting</a>). It is the only building resource for all of Syrnia's shops, houses and boats. You also need a hammer to build things. Money is another key resource. You may also need to study, to further boost your levels. This can be very expensive.<br />
<br />
<h3> 			Where to study<br />
</h3>
There are many places throughout Syrnia where you can go to study how to build things. Every location has limits in some way, either what you need to study there, or the limits you can learn. Once you have reached the limit for that place, you must move on to the next location if you are to advance.

Of course, learning how to build things is not free. You must pay gold pieces to keep on studying. For every session of the timer, you gain 20 experience points. You also have the gold deducted from your inventory. This cost increases as your levels increase. The cost is the same at all Universities and Schools.<br />

<h3> How to build </h3>
To build something, first equip a hammer and click once on the city name in the city menu (to refresh the screen). Click the &quot;construct&quot; above &quot;player shops&quot; and then in the center work screen select the item you would like to construct. Remember you can only have one house or shop in each location, but once built you do have the option to upgrade with only an additional cost in wood. You will need different amounts of wood to build different things with bigger buildings needing more wood. For more details, see the table below.<br />
<h3><br />
How to Demolish</h3>
If you aren't happy, you can demolish your house or shop. On the options for your home or shop, click the option saying &quot;Destroy my house&quot; or &quot;Destroy the shop&quot;. It will then ask you to confirm your choice at the top of the menu. Once confirmed, the building will be destroyed instantly and you will get back some of the wood you used to build it. Beware, if you have any items or gold in your home or shop and you then decide to destroy it, the items and gold will be lost.<br />
<h3>How to Upgrade</h3>
Houses and shops can also be upgraded in size. This requires no construction level to upgrade but it does require significantly more wood than if it were built from nothing. This is because you would have to spend a lot of money paying for construction levels to build a house of that size, but upgrading requires no extra levels and so creates balance. You can however, achieve sizes of homes not noted in the list. There is a limit though onto how much it can be upgraded. Houses are around the 10,000 slot size.<br />
<h3><br />
Houses</h3>
Houses are storage places for items. Items are stored in &quot;slots&quot;, with one item per slot. Remember that several of one type of item do not count as one and for example10 logs of wood require 10 slots in a house. Every item though, takes up just one slot each, no matter how big. Bigger houses can hold more items and require much more wood to build them.<br />

<h3> 			Building Shops</h3>
Shops allow you to sell items to players. These are built in the same way as a house and follow the same rules (One item = one slot). With houses however, these are also dependant upon your trading level, and if you do not have a high enough trading level, you will not be able to use all the slots that your shop can provide.

Boats are required for fishing and are needed to catch the larger fish. The only exception to this is the Brigantine.
