<h1> 			<img alt="" src="http://www.syrnia.com/images/skills/trading.gif" /> Trading 		</h1>
Trading is concerned with the amount of items a player can sell in their shop at once. When you first build a shop (see Constructing), you will only be able to sell a few items at once. As your trading level goes up, you will be able to  		sell a lot more items. Trading also affects how much bids and auctions you can have at the same time (at the auction house: Cave of Trades).Trading will also unlock the 'Shop search' option. Good traders know where to find shops to buy the stuff they need.<br />
Below is a table of trading search option levels.<br />

To get your trading level up, you need to study. Studying will cost you money.<br />
Select the <em>University or School </em> 		option at an appropriate location to start studying. 		<br />
<br />
<h3> 			Where to study</h3>
Trading, like <a href="http://www.syrnia.com/index.php?page=manual&amp;m=constructing">Construction</a>, can be studied to boost experience. The locations are usually the same, and so are the level limitations.

Remember, like the Construction skill, to study trading, you need to pay gold pieces. After each session, when the timer reaches 0, you will gain 20 Experience points and the gold cost is automatically deducted from your inventory. If you do not have enough gold to continue, then your training stops until you are able to return with more. The cost increases as your levels rise and is the same across all Schools and Universites in Syrnia.<br />

<h3>Player Shops</h3>
Players can also use shops to sell goods to others. First you need to build a shop, this requires <a href="http://www.syrnia.com/index.php?page=manual&amp;m=constructing">Construction</a> and also plenty of wood to build with. You need to make sure that you have a high enouhg trading level, as your trading level controls how many shop slots you can run. If you can only support 20 shops in a 50 slot size of shop for example, then you can only use those 20. The other 30 are unavailable.<br />
<br />
Once you have built a shop, you can then put items in it. Set the price of the items and how many you wish to sell. You can keep on doing this and add or remove items until you are happy. Remember that if you want to change the prices, you will need to remove all items of that type and put them back in with a new price. Give your shop a name and maybe a description and you will be open for business. Your shop will be selling items whether or not you are in the area or even if you are online or not. Every time an item is sold, you receive a message telling you who bought it, how many they bought and for how much gold. This gold is then stored in the shop. It remains here until you go there to collect it. Remember that if you do not collect it regularly, it may get stolen (see <a href="http://www.syrnia.com/index.php?page=manual&amp;m=thieving">Thieving</a>).<br />
<br />
<h4> Trading Posts </h4>
<br />
Trading items between players can be done at any of the trading posts located around the islands. Once at the city, click trading post in the city menu. Once the screen refreshes you will see a list of player names in the centre of the screen. Click trade next to the player's name you have agreed to trade with and once they accept the trade request you will be taken to the trading screen. Add the items and the quantity of each you wish to trade and once all the agreed upon items are displayed click accept, located above the items lists. (Should you click accept before the other player is ready, they will have the option to &quot;change trade&quot; to add or remove items or to &quot;accept&quot;) Once the screen refreshes you will see an overview of the items being traded and will be given one last chance to cancel the trade before it is completed. Click accept one last time and wait for the &quot;Trade completed successfully&quot; and you're done. <br />

<h4>Cave of Trades</h4>
<p>There is another method of item sale available in Syrnia. This is known as the Cave of Trades. It was founded by Ogre Trendus. Players can go to these places and they can auction their items. All Cave of Trades on the map work in exactly the same way and will all offer the exact same selection of auctions and offers. Players will decide what item(s) they wish to put up for sale, how many of that item and then for how long they wish to leave the auction open. An auction can be left for either six hours, 12 hours, 24 hours or 48 hours. Once the item has been put up for auction, it cannot be taken down. <br />
</p>
<p><br />
During that time however, players can bid for that item. They must bid at least 1% more than the current highest bid to take control and have the top offer. At any time though, someone could go into the Cave of Trades and place a bid on that item that is higher than your bid. If that happens, they spend their gold to take control and hold the highest bid and the player who originally had control is given a message informing them that they have lost control and returns their money. At the end of the time, whoever holds the highest bid will win the item, which is then delivered to their inventory. If however, no bids were taken on an item at all, you receive a notice that it did not sell and you must return to the Cave of Trades to collect it. You can have auctions running while bidding on others, (but you cannot bid on your own lots!).</p>
