With the sole responsibility of answering questions of players in Game Help, a (Guide) has no additional responsibilities or power other than distributing their knowledge of Syrnia.

<P LANG="fr-FR" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><SPAN LANG="en-US">As a Syrnia official you will have to hold yourself to a set of criteria which will ensure that quality and reliable information in the Syrnia Game Help channel is provided to all players. These criteria will be monitored and controlled by the Lead Guide, who is your contact for any game related questions or issues you may face. The Guide Chat [89] channel is available to all (Guide) members should they require any assistance to the questions being asked in Game Help, or to discuss any given situation which jeopardizes the responsibilities of you as a (Guide). This channel is also used to communicate your (Guide) activity should the "On Duty" (Guide) need to relinquish their "On Duty" status at that time.</SPAN></P>

<strong>Syrnia Rules Act (2009)</strong> Last edited 3 December 2011<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Section 1 - Introduction</strong><br />
<br />
These rules apply to all players.  It is strongly recommended that you read the rules regularly to keep yourself familiar with current updates.<br />
<br />
We reserve the right to add/edit the rules as necessary. These changes will be announced. All registered players using the Syrnia gaming environment automatically accept any changes to the rules.<br />
<br />
If you do not understand a rule, contact the game staff for help.<br />

<br />
<i>Ignorance is not an acceptable excuse to break the rules.</i><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Section 2 - Joining</strong><br />
<br />
1. Syrnia is available to anyone over 13 years of age or older. If you are under the age of 13, unfortunately you will not be able to register to use Syrnia.<br />
2. If you are at least 13 but under 18, please also ask a parent or guardian to read and agree to the terms and conditions of this site.
    Parents and Guardians of users under 18 will be responsible for their minor's use of the site.
    They agree to the terms of use on behalf of themselves and any minor 13 or older.<br />
3. In consideration of our making Syrnia accessible to you, you agree to provide accurate current and complete information about yourself as requested in the registration form. If you provide registration information which is inaccurate or untrue, we reserve the right to not allow you to access Syrnia.<br />
4. We also reserve the right to communicate with you at the email address provided with regard to updates to the Syrnia site, changes of policies and your use of the site.
   This does not limit your right to opt out of receiving communications from Syrnia or other companies of a marketing nature.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Section 3 - Player Accounts</strong><br />
<br />
1. Players are permitted only ONE account per person to access the game. Violation of this rule will result in all accounts being frozen.<br />
<br />
2. No one (whether registered as a player with their own account or not) is permitted to access another person's account for any reason whatsoever even if it is a family member or friend. Violation of this rule will result in heavy punishments and/or being frozen.<br />
<br />
3. Players are responsible for anything said or done on their account with or without their permission. This includes intervention by family members or friends.<br />
<br />

4. Should family members or friends who are on the same network or shared computer wish to join the game, players must contact game staff first. In such cases, the following will apply:<br />
<br />
a. If accounts will share a computer, only one account can be active and playing at any one time. Log out first before another player logs in using the same computer.<br />
<br />
b. Players are required to inform staff of the username of all the accounts which will be under such conditions.<br />
<br />
c. Do not play or login for each other. Entering bot checks for each other is considered cheating.<br />
 <br />
5. Any usernames deemed inappropriate, offensive, spam-like or aimed to impersonate staff will result in the account being frozen.<br />
<br />
6. Name changes can only be done once. Take this into account when creating your character. Contact the Cheats/Multi department for a one time only name change.<br />

<br />
7. Account trading of any form is not permitted in Syrnia. Do not use game chats, forum, in game messages, other online games or online auction sites to:<br />
<br />
a. Trade Syrnian goods or game accounts.<br />
b. Trade accounts from any other online game.<br />
c. Donate for others in exchange for Syrnia gp or benefits.<br />
d. Trade items from one game for items in Syrnia.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Section 4 - English Only</strong><br />
<br />

Players are only permitted to use the English language on the public forum and chat.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Section 5 - Hacking</strong><br />
<br />
1. Do not attempt to hack into the game or another player's account. Anyone found attempting this will have their account frozen.<br />
<br />
2. If you suspect hacking is taking place, report it to the Cheats/Exploits/ Multis department immediately.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Section 6 - Bots and/or Scripts</strong><br />
<br />

1. The use of bots to control your character is not permitted. Anyone found using them risks having their account frozen.<br />
<br />
2. User scripts (for example, greasemonkey) are not permitted in Syrnia regardless of their function.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Section 7 - Game Bugs</strong><br />
<br />
1. If you find a fault with the game, report it to staff immediately.<br />
<br />
2. If one of these bugs allows you to gain an unfair advantage over other players, do not exploit it. Exploitation of these problems will result in loss of any experience and/or items along with being jailed or frozen.<br />
<br />
3. Any player deaths caused as a result of &quot;lag&quot; will not be compensated. This is because there are many possible reasons for this, both on the player's part and on Syrnia's part.<br />

<br />
<br />
<strong>Section 8 - Player Punishment</strong><br />
<br />
1. If you break any section of the Syrnia Rules Act, you risk punishment. All punishments are determined at the discretion of staff members and will be based on the severity of the current offence and any previous offences.<br />
<br />
2. The staff is not required to warn players before punishing them. The Syrnia Rules Act is the warning for all players.<br />
<br />
3. Repeated violation of the rules will result in extended punishments, permanent withdrawal of chat and/or forum privileges or your account being frozen.<br />
<br />
4. Player punishment is between the player and the staff.  Third party intervention is not permitted.  The staff has the right to ignore any questions from third parties and punish them for interference. <br />
<br />

5. Posting in the chats or forum on behalf of those who are punished is not acceptable.  Anyone taking these actions will face punishment themselves.<br />
<br />
6. If you have a question about your punishment, you may consult the appropriate department for a clarification and the reasoning behind it. Remember though, that abusive or unpleasant language towards staff will not be tolerated.<br />
<br />
7. You may choose to further question the punishment in which case another moderator will review it, reply and finalize the ticket. Please be aware that this decision is final. Continual disputes after a final decision will result in an increased punishment.<br />
<br />
8. This is the typical sequence of questioning a punishment.<br />
<br />
a. A mod informs you of a punishment for your actions.<br />
b. You send a ticket questioning the punishment.<br />
c. A mod clarifies why you received the punishment.<br />

d. You question the punishment again providing more information and clarification of your position.<br />
e. Another mod reviews your ticket sending you the final decision.<br />
f. You have now received 3 communications on this one topic and it is closed.  <br />
g. Asking or demanding that a senior mod replies to you is not an option.<br />
h. There will be times when a ticket will require more than 3 responses from the Moderation staff. This is solely at the discretion of the Moderator(s) handling the ticket.<br />
<br />
9. On the rare occasion where staff believes that the behavior of a player has reached a point where further action could result in a player account being frozen, the player will receive a Final Warning. Should the behavior continue after this warning the player risks having their account temporarily or permanently frozen.<br />
<br />
10. The rules are designed to make this a positive gaming experience for all. Every attempt has been made to cover all the known problem areas.  However, if something new comes up that adversely effects the game play or the Syrnia community the staff will address it with warnings and or punishments.<br />
<br />

11. Please remember the spirit of the rules is far more important than the literal wording as players who actively seek loopholes to engage in questionable acts will be penalized.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Section 9 - Player Harassment</strong><br />
<br />
1. Harassing behavior towards players is unacceptable. Players found doing so will be punished. Harassing behavior includes but is not limited to:<br />
<br />
a. Comments against someone in chats or forum threads.<br />
b. Sending unwanted or offensive messages.<br />
c. Sending unwanted or offensive whispers.<br />
d. Sending sexual messages or communications.<br />

e. Soliciting or engaging in sexual conduct, consensual or otherwise.<br />
<br />
2. If you feel you are being harassed by another player, ask them to stop and or use the Ignore Player option.  If harassment continues send evidence to Registration/Game Information Department.<br />
<br />
3. If a player asks you to stop contacting them, you are to stop doing so. Failure to comply can result in punishment.<br />
<br />
4. a. The staff can check whisper or message content between two players to ensure that no fake records were submitted. They can also ensure that one party has not attempted to antagonize the other. <br />
<br />
b. If the staff finds that you were also responsible for the incident or were found to have been trolling in some way, you will be punished as well.<br />
<br />
5. You cannot solicit or engage in sexual conduct in this game, consensual or otherwise.<br />

<br />
6. If we get credible evidence, that violate these rules, particularly if these acts involve minors, you will be banned from the game.<br />
<br />
7. Note that thieving is NOT classed as harassing behavior.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Section 10 - Moderation</strong><br />
<br />
1. The staff are here to keep the game safe and provide an enjoyable gaming experience for all.<br />
<br />
2. The Syrnia staff is any person that assists in the creation and maintenance of Syrnia. This includes the administrator and creator of Syrnia, and all moderators, both public and private.<br />
<br />

3. The staff has the right to perform their duties without being harassed or insulted.<br />
<br />
4. Abusive language and inappropriate conduct against staff will not be tolerated and punishment will be issued.<br />
<br />
5. Players are forbidden to provoke the moderators against them in a deliberate way. Posts made for the purpose of creating a personal conflict between players and staff will be deleted and their authors punished.<br />
<br />
6. Players who disrupt the community will be denied access to the chats or forum.<br />
<br />
7. Impersonation of staff is a serious offence and will result in heavy punishments.<br />
<br />
8. If you suspect any form of rule breaking, report it to the staff. Do not go after other players that you perceive are breaking the rules.<br />

<br />
<br />
<strong>Section 11 - Tickets and Reports</strong><br />
<br />
Tickets and Reports are the method for players to communicate with the staff.<br />
<br />
Syrnia rules apply to tickets and reports. The following are guidelines for submission.  <br />
<br />
1. Be civil when addressing an issue. If the staff believes that you are harassing them it will result in a punishment.<br />
<br />
2. Inappropriate language or repeatedly sending in a ticket on an already resolved issue is unacceptable.  The staff reserves the right to refuse to deal with inappropriate tickets.<br />
<br />

3. Address one issue per ticket. Open a new ticket for different topics to avoid confusion on either side.<br />
<br />
4. When filing a report/ticket, please include the relevant lines from the chat history, message(s) or the forum path with a description of what happened.<br />
<br />
5. Do not post tickets or their content in the forum or chats.<br />
<br />
6. Please note senior mods review communication from players and will intervene as necessary. It is not appropriate to ask for a senior mod to communicate with you if you disagree with other mods.<br />
<br />
7. In some cases the staff will send a ticket asking for information or an explanation. These tickets are time sensitive and require an immediate reply.  <br />
<br />
8. Please do not close tickets after you send a response. Closed tickets cannot be seen in the incoming section.<br />

<br />
9. Posting player punishment, tickets or ticket contents in the forum or chat is not allowed. Players who have done so in the past omit or embelish facts to present themselves as innocent of rule breaking or as martyrs.<br />
 <br />
